# Access an EC2 instance shell from the AWS console

Now we will access an EC2 instance shell from the AWS console. We will accomplish it by completing each task in the project:

Task 1: Create a security group

Task 2: Launch an Amazon EC2 Instance

Task 3: Connect to the instance using the AWS browser-based SSH client

Task 4: Install Apache HTTP server using a browser-based SSH client

Task 5: Deploy web application using a browser-based SSH client

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above-mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
